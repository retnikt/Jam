# jamm
(formerly Jam)  
A linux macro tool for Ã¼ber-nerds, productivity porn-stars, and, like, I dunno, stage lighting operators?

## About
jamm (formerly Jam) is a scripting language similar to 
[AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com), based on XML.  
Not to be confused with [Jam](https://lets-jam.org) or [Jam STAPL](https://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/download/programming/jam.html)
### Rationale
This is a tool for linux because there are loads of
similar Windows alternatives, but very few equivalents
for linux. Maybe in the future I will release a Windows
version, but it would require a significant rewrite.

Python 2 is not supported, and never will be, because 
[it will not be maintained past 2020.](https://pythonclock.org)
