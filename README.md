 - ~~Additional Keyboards, mice, etc.~~ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 - MIDI devices
 - ~~USB/Serial devices (e.g. Arduinos)~~ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 - ~~TCP clients (port 6999 by default, configurable)~~ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 - ~~A customisable HTTP interface (e.g. for mobile devices)~~ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 
to almost anything else:
 - Console commands
 - ~~Other key combinations~~ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 - ~~File operations~~ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

## Installation
*TODO*
